# Light Breeze

A theme for Pale Moon using [Breeze](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/breeze-icons) icons. This theme is based on [Lootyhoof's default theme template](https://github.com/Lootyhoof/theme-template). 

## Building

Simply download the contents of the "src" folder  and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

On Unix systems (or Windows 10, with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) you can optionally run `build.sh` instead. Running this as-is will produce a .xpi file ending in `-dev`, and if run from the command line and appending a number (e.g. `./build.sh 2`) will append that number to the filename instead.

## Download

You can grab the latest release from the Releases section of this repository.
